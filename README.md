# Procedural Generation using Perlin Noise
This project was created by following a YouTube video series. The end goal was to create infinite or island based terrain. There are a lot of optimizations done to allow for lower spec'd computers to run the game.

## Work In Progress
This entire project is a work in progress, and is mainly used as a learning process for game development in the 3D space using Unity. The content you can expect from this project goes as follows:
- Fully controllable third person character.
- Infinite terrain / Island based terrain
- Draw on foilage / procedurally generated foilage. (i.e. trees, grass, weeds, etc.)
- Interactable water (Splashing, water swimming effects, etc.)

Content planned for the future goes as follows:
- Enemies with simple to intermediate AI
- Sword & shield / fist combat
- Fully animated character

## Unity
This was created using Unity v2020 LTS.
