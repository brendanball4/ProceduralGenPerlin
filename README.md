# Procedural Generation using Perlin Noise
This is a project followed by a YouTube video series. The end goal was to create a infinite or island based terrain, that goes on forever. There are a lot of optimizations done to allow for weaker computers to run the game.

## Unity
This was created using Unity v2020 LTS.
